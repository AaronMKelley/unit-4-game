# unit-4-game
The is a number based game where at the start users are presented with a random number between 19-120. They also have 4 different colored crystals that all have a random interger that ranges from 1-12. The objective of the game is to match the total of the random number without going over. Failing to do so will result in a loss and require the user to restart the game using the "Restart" button and their lost total goes up by one. If they succeed their win total goes up by one and they will have to click "Restart" to play again. For each new game a new randomized number will appear and all four crytsals will be reassigned numbers.
